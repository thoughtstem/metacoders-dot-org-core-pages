    Once upon a time, there was a city. In that city, on a day that seemed otherwise normal, one person (who shall be named @b{____} until you refresh the page) woke up with the realization:
    } 

    @blockquote{
    "Coding education is broken."
    } 

    @p{
    @b{____} had heard of the shortages of programmers in the software industry. @b{____} had heard that coders could make more than $100,000 per year. @b{____} had heard that coding boot camps were selling 10-week classes for $10,000 or more. @b{____}’s Facebook ads were full of for-profit tech summer camps for kids – with price tags over $1,000. @b{____} had also heard that coding should be a basic literacy, something everyone on the planet ought to have access to.
    }


    @p{
    @b{____} was puzzled that people could be making such a profit off of something like that. Online research brought up a site called metacoders.org. After clicking the Learn More link, @b{____} read a story about someone (with a different name, in a different city) who had begun to realize the same things.
    }

    @p{
    @b{____} discovered that there were six ways to join MetaCoders – two of which would allow @b{____} or other community members to get paid to learn to code, and one of which would allow @b{____}’s children to learn to code at affordable prices starting as low as $0.
    }

    @p{
    From that day forward, that otherwise normal city was no longer normal. @b{____} made it "go meta".
    }))
