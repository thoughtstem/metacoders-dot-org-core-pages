You can apply the credits you purchase to any of our unfilled scheduled sessions. You do not have to apply all of your purchased credits all at once. We keep track of how many credits each customer has so that you can wait to apply them until a time that is convenient for you!")
                  (li (b "I purchased Quarantine Credits! Now, how do I use them to sign up for Coding Club sessions?") " After you purchase, you'll be directed to fill out a short form to send us your students' registration information and your preferred schedule. If you purchase credits during our normal business hours (Monday-Friday 9am-5pm PST), someone from our team will be notified and will email you within the hour to confirm your registration. If you do not receive this email within 2 hours, please call us at (858) 375-4097. If you purchase credits outside of our business hours (Monday-Friday 9am-5pm PST), someone from our team will email you during our next scheduled business hours to help you get enrolled in any of our unfilled sessions.") 
                  (li (b "How many sessions should I enroll my student in?") " We recommend no more than 1 session per day. Sessions within the same day will essentially be covering the same material. The material for sessions varies significantly from day-to-day.")
                  (li (b "I'm interested in volunteering... what kinds of volunteer opportunities are there?") " Volunteers help in a variety of ways! Some volunteers are like traffic controllers, helping direct students to their preferred educational activities. Other volunteers help run targeted educational activities. Still other volunteers lead 5-minute stretch and exercise breaks to help get students moving! We believe volunteering should always be fun, so we'll help you find something that matches your interests.")
                  (li (b "Can I get free Quarantine Credits for my children by volunteering?") " This is the best part about being an educational co-op! By putting in your time and energy, you can get free educational opportunities for your children. Volunteers can receive 1 Quarantine Credit for every 30 minutes of volunteer time (that's 1-hr of education for kids for every 30 minutes of volunteer time.)")
                  (li (b "As a volunteer, can I gift my free Quarantine Credits to someone else?") " Absolutely! We have grandparents who volunteer and gift their credits to their grandchildren. Same with aunts and uncles for their nieces and nephews. You can also gift credits to someone outside your family.")
                  (li (b "I want to sign-up as a volunteer! What do I need to do?") " We're so excited to have you join our community! The first step is to fill out the volunteer interest form " (a href: "https://bit.ly/metacoders-volunteer-form" "here") ". After that, we'll follow-up with you over email with next steps.")
                  (li (b "Do I need to install anything in order to participate?") " Yes. Our coaches teach through the free platform Zoom, which would need to be installed on your computer. You can find installation instructions for the Zoom Client for Meetings " (a href: "https://zoom.us/download" "here") ". Depending on the session, you may also be asked to install certain coding language environments on your computer, or Coaches may walk students through this installation process during a session.") 
                  (li (b "Can I still sign up for a session that starts today?") " You can sign up for any scheduled session, that is not yet full, up until 2 hours before the session begins. Please note: at this time, a customer service representative will email you after your purchase to help schedule your sessions. However, we are currently in the process of building an interface for customers to apply their credits to sessions themselves.")

In the meantime, we are trying to keep the calendar above up-to-date as best we can. However, depending on how quickly spots in our sessions fill, some sessions may be full by the time we help you schedule your sessions. But not to worry: we'll work with you to make sure we can find a spot in a session that works with your schedule.") 
                  (li (b "What equipment do I need in order to participate?") " All you need to participate in our Quarantine Coding Club is a computer, a keyboard, and an internet connection! We also ask students to bring paper and pencil to sessions as well.")

We understand parents don't always have enough devices for all their students. Clearly, two students who are sharing 1 laptop can't code at the same time, so we are treating each device as if it is one student at this time.")

" Yes, in order to be as transparent as possible with parents, we try to record all sessions; parents can ask us for these screen recordings whenever they'd like. Often, we will pre-emptively send screen recordings to parents so that parents can see what their children are learning inside our digital classrooms. Some screen recordings will also be used for marketing purposes. If sessions are used for marketing purposes, we will ensure that no identifying information like names or locations are shown.
